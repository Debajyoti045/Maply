This full-stack web application features an Interactive Campus Map using open-source tools like Leaflet and OpenStreetMap. Users can dynamically pin locations, from departments to food outlets, with real-time event integration via open APIs. Icons differentiate location types, and tagging allows easy categorization. An info page for each location includes editable details, while an Administrative Control Panel empowers campus authorities with content management and usage monitoring capabilities.
